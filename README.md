# Portfolio

This is my new developer portfolio, hand coded using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Sanity CDN

The front-end was built using Next.js, with Tailwind for styling and Framer motion for animations. I incorporated a Sanity CDN for cloud storage of assets and the ability to update key information on the page from Sanity Studio, using Sanity's API and unique query language; GROQ. My favourite part of the page is the animated circles and Typewriter element in the hero section, as well as the little animations that make the site much snappier and smoother.

The portfolio is fully responsive with Tailwind styling, which I found much more intuitive and easy to work with than regular CSS. However in future projects I will make better use of global styles, as the Tailwind code isn't as DRY as it could be.

## Lessons Learned

Deploying this project was a difficult process that gave me valuable lessons in runtime vs compile-time deployment settings, conflicting TypeScript configs and setting up API's with CDN's (to name a few). 
Overall the use of Next.js and learning about Static Site Generation and Incremental Static Regeneration was an interesting and enjoyable experience.

## Optimizations and next steps
- add buttons to horizontal scroll between components
- deploy as main portfolio website
