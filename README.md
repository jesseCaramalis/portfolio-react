# Portfolio

This is my new developer portfolio, hand coded using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Sanity CDN

The frontend was built using Next.js, with Tailwind for styling. Sanity.io was used as a CDN, so I can update important information from anywhere with Sanity Studio.
TypeScript was used for type checking values from the CDN, which made the build a lot easier. This was my first time using Next.js, and I found it much more versatile despite being an opinionated framework. The pre-rendering also made the page much snappier, and I'm in the process of fully utilising the Image elements for faster image loading.

I also found using Tailwind much more intuitive, although it did open myself up for less DRY code as I am still learning to group similar patterns under global rules.

Overall I found the page very pleasing to write and style with these utilities.

## Optimizations

- finish responsive css
- implement Next.js Images
- fix visual bugs with skill component
- add all current projects to cdn
- add buttons to indicate horizontal scrol of project component
